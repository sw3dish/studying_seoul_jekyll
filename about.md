Hi! My name's Colin -- I'm an American student studying at Yonsei University in Seoul for the winter and spring terms of 2016.

While here at Yonsei, I'll be studying Korean and taking a few classes for my home school, the University of Maryland, College Park, as well as working for a Seoul-based startup! Of course, I'll be documenting food and nightlife as well!

Thanks for reading!
