So, I've been in Seoul now for about a month. It's been an interesting time filled
with cool people, lots of good food and drink, and general sightseeing. I'll be
trying to cram a month of Korea into this post (since I haven't exactly been
responsible with my posting), so this might be rather lengthy -- stick with me, though!

### Why am I in Korea?

I'm part of an Honors program at the University of Maryland,
the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program, that set up a study abroad program,
the Global Entrepreneurship Semester, to allow students to experience startup
culture, as well as college life, in different countries. This year, which was the
first year that EIP has offered the GES (nice acronyms, right?), three
countries were offered to travel to:

* Seoul, South Korea
* Istanbul, Turkey
* Tel Aviv, Israel

I've been to Seoul before (in the summer before my senior year) and really
like the city -- I was also born in Seoul and want to get to know it better. The
other two cities, while in interesting countries, didn't really offer anything more
than Seoul. In addition, the college that the GES was run through in Korea, Yonsei
University, is widely regarded as one of the top schools in the country.

### So what have I been doing for a month?

The Global Entrepreneurship Semester began in late January at Yonsei University
with their Winter Abroad at Yonsei program. So, almost as soon as I stepped off
of the plane at Incheon International Airport, I began taking a class in Modern
Korean History and a class in basic Korean language. I had class for about 4
hours each day, which left me a lot of time to do other things like eat, drink,
and travel! (More to come about all of these later!)

### Where do I live?

I live in the Yonsei International House in a double with my roommate from UMD,
Adam. The International House, as well as the SK Global House next to it, houses
exchange students from all over the world that study at Yonsei. In addition to
having many floors of rooms, it has a basement that has a convenience store,
a few restaurants and coffee shops, and a travel agency for East Asia. It's not
an awful place to live, although the rooms are much smaller than the ones at UMD.
I think it's because I've been spending a lot less time in my room -- I really
only am in it to sleep!

It's on the Yonsei campus,
but is a short walk to Sinchon, the nearest "neighborhood" in Seoul, which has
many restaurants and bars, as well as the nearest subway station.

I'll be updating this site pretty regularly, so stay tuned to see what I'm doing!
